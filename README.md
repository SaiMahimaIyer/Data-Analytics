2.Polynomial Regression on Boston Housing Dataset
In this notebook we do a comparative study of Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression accuracy on the Boston Housing Dataset

There are 506 samples and 13 feature variables in this data-set. The objective is to predict the value of prices of the house using the given features.

The description of all the features is given below:

CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town

ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft

INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town

CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)

RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling

AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers

RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways

TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000

B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)Â², where Bk is the proportion of [people of African American descent] by town

LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population

MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s
